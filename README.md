# Identifying neighborhood change

Classify Census tracts in the United States as gentrifying or declining using the 3-D "double-decile difference" methodology in [Landis (2015)](http://www.penniur.upenn.edu/uploads/media/John-Landis-Working-Paper-Neighborhood-Change.pdf) with slight modifications.

You will need to create a "keys.R" file with your Census API key using the following format:

`census_api_key('<YOUR KEY HERE>', install = TRUE)`

You will also need to download the [Longitudinal Tract Data Base](https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/researcher/ltdb.htm) developed by the US2010 Project at Brown University.
